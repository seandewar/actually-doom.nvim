Includes the shareware version of DOOM v1.9 for your convenience.

==============================================================================
PREREQUISITES					*actually-doom-prerequisites*

To use this plugin, the following is required:

- Neovim v0.11+ with the LuaJIT `string.buffer` library. (Available in typical
  Neovim installations)
- Linux.
- C compiler with support for the C99 standard.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*actually-doom-commands*

						*:Doom*
:[N]Doom[!] [iwad]	Play DOOM.  If [N] is given, it is the buffer number
			of an existing screen to switch to.  If [iwad] is
			given, it is the path of the IWAD file to use.

			If [!] or [iwad] is present then a new instance of
			DOOM is started regardless of whether one is already
			running.

==============================================================================
GAME CONTROLS				*actually-doom-game-controls*

Controls are similar to vanilla DOOM's.  The most important are:

						*actually-doom_<Esc>*
<Esc>			Toggle the menu.

						*actually-doom_<CR>*
<CR>			Select menu option.

						*actually-doom_x*
x			Fire equipped weapon.

			NOTE: Vanilla DOOM uses <CTRL> for this, but Nvim (and
			many terminals) can't detect a lone <CTRL> that wasn't
			used as a modifier for a different key.

						*actually-doom_<Space>*
<Space>			Use button: open doors, activate switches, etc.

			   *actually-doom_<Up>* *actually-doom_<Down>*
<Up> <Down>		Move in the pressed direction.
			 *actually-doom_<S-Up>* *actually-doom_<S-Down>*
<S-Up> <S-Down>		When combined with shift, sprint instead.

			 *actually-doom_<Left>* *actually-doom_<Right>*
<Left> <Right>		Turn towards the pressed direction.
		       *actually-doom_<S-Left>* *actually-doom_<S-Right>*
<S-Left> <S-Right>	When combined with shift, quickly turn instead.
		       *actually-doom_<M-Left>* *actually-doom_<M-Right>*
<M-Left> <M-Right>	When combined with meta (alt), strafe instead.

						*actually-doom_number*
0 - 8			Equip a different weapon from your inventory.

						*actually-doom_<Tab>*
<Tab>			Open the level automap.


PLUGIN CONTROLS				*actually-doom-plugin-controls*

The following controls are available for toggling plugin-specific features:

						*actually-doom_<C-K>*
CTRL-K			Toggle kitty graphics protocol support.  This works
			only in supported terminals.  |actually-doom-kitty|

						*actually-doom_<C-T>*
CTRL-T			Toggle tmux passthrough support. |actually-doom-tmux|

==============================================================================
KITTY GRAPHICS PROTOCOL				*actually-doom-kitty*

Though optional, the game is best experienced in a terminal that implements
the kitty graphics protocol with support for Unicode placeholders.
(https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol)

In a supported terminal, it can be toggled in-game by pressing CTRL-K.

Because shared memory is used to transmit frame data for performance reasons,
this does NOT work remotely! (E.g: SSH)


TMUX PASSTHROUGH				*actually-doom-tmux*

Passthrough sequences are supported for tmux, which must be enabled to use
kitty graphics under tmux.  For tmux v3.3+, it can be turned on using
`set -g allow-passthrough on`.

Note that the host terminal must still support the graphics protocol for this
to be effective.

actually-doom.nvim automatically uses passthrough sequences if the `$TMUX`
environment variable is set, but it can be toggled manually by pressing CTRL-T
in-game.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHT GROUPS				*actually-doom-highlights*

The following |:hi-default| definitions exist for use in console buffers:

						*hl-DoomConsoleError*
DoomConsoleError	Error messages.

						*hl-DoomConsoleWarn*
DoomConsoleWarn		Warning messages.

						*hl-DoomConsolePlugin*
DoomConsolePlugin	General plugin-specific messages.

						*hl-DoomConsoleDebug*
DoomConsoleDebug	Messages useful for debugging actually-doom.
