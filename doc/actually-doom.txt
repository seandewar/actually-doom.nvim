*actually-doom.txt*	Actually play DOOM in your favourite text editor!

Author:  Sean Dewar <https://github.com/seandewar>
License: GPL-2.0

Includes the shareware version of DOOM v1.9 for your convenience.

==============================================================================
PREREQUISITES					*actually-doom-prerequisites*

To use this plugin, the following is required:

- Neovim v0.11+ with the LuaJIT `string.buffer` library. (Available in typical
  Neovim installations)
- Linux.
- C compiler with support for the C99 standard.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*actually-doom-commands*

						*:Doom*
:[N]Doom[!] [iwad]	Play DOOM.  If [N] is given, it is the buffer number
			of an existing screen to switch to.  If [iwad] is
			given, it is the path of the IWAD file to use.

			If [!] or [iwad] is present then a new instance of
			DOOM is started regardless of whether one is already
			running.

==============================================================================
GAME CONTROLS				*actually-doom-game-controls*

Controls are similar to vanilla DOOM's.  The most important are:

						*actually-doom_<Esc>*
<Esc>			Toggle the menu.

						*actually-doom_<CR>*
<CR>			Select menu option.

						*actually-doom_x*
x			Fire equipped weapon.

			NOTE: Vanilla DOOM uses <CTRL> for this, but Nvim (and
			many terminals) can't detect a lone <CTRL> that wasn't
			used as a modifier for a different key.

						*actually-doom_<Space>*
<Space>			Use button: open doors, activate switches, etc.

			   *actually-doom_<Up>* *actually-doom_<Down>*
<Up> <Down>		Move in the pressed direction.
			 *actually-doom_<S-Up>* *actually-doom_<S-Down>*
<S-Up> <S-Down>		When combined with shift, sprint instead.

			 *actually-doom_<Left>* *actually-doom_<Right>*
<Left> <Right>		Turn towards the pressed direction.
		       *actually-doom_<S-Left>* *actually-doom_<S-Right>*
<S-Left> <S-Right>	When combined with shift, quickly turn instead.
		       *actually-doom_<M-Left>* *actually-doom_<M-Right>*
<M-Left> <M-Right>	When combined with meta (alt), strafe instead.

						*actually-doom_number*
0 - 8			Equip a different weapon from your inventory.

						*actually-doom_<Tab>*
<Tab>			Open the level automap.


PLUGIN CONTROLS				*actually-doom-plugin-controls*

The following controls are available for toggling plugin-specific features:

						*actually-doom_<C-K>*
CTRL-K			Toggle kitty graphics protocol support.  This works
			only in supported terminals.  |actually-doom-kitty|

						*actually-doom_<C-T>*
CTRL-T			Toggle tmux passthrough support. |actually-doom-tmux|

==============================================================================
KITTY GRAPHICS PROTOCOL				*actually-doom-kitty*

Though optional, the game is best experienced in a terminal that implements
the kitty graphics protocol with support for Unicode placeholders.
(https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol)

In a supported terminal, it can be toggled in-game by pressing CTRL-K.

Because shared memory is used to transmit frame data for performance reasons,
this does NOT work remotely! (E.g: SSH)


TMUX PASSTHROUGH				*actually-doom-tmux*

Passthrough sequences are supported for tmux, which must be enabled to use
kitty graphics under tmux.  For tmux v3.3+, it can be turned on using
`set -g allow-passthrough on`.

Note that the host terminal must still support the graphics protocol for this
to be effective.

actually-doom.nvim automatically uses passthrough sequences if the `$TMUX`
environment variable is set, but it can be toggled manually by pressing CTRL-T
in-game.


Your preferences for these settings can be saved by calling
|actually-doom.setup()| within your |config|.  For example, to always enable
both kitty graphics and tmux passthrough support, add the following Lua code:
>lua
	require("actually-doom").setup {
		game = {
			kitty_graphics = true,
			tmux_passthrough = true,
		},
	}

==============================================================================
LUA API						*actually-doom-api*

The following APIs can be accessed from `require("actually-doom")`:

setup({config})					*actually-doom.setup()*
	Configure actually-doom.nvim's defaults.

	NOTE: Calling this function is unnecessary if you are happy with the
	defaults.

	Parameters: ~
	• {config}  `(table?)` Optional configuration values:
		• {game} (`table?`, default: nil)
		  Default `opts` for |actually-doom.play()|.
		• {build} (`table?`, default: nil)
		  Default `opts` for |actually-doom.rebuild()|.

play({opts})					*actually-doom.play()*
	Launch a new instance of DOOM.

	Parameters: ~
	• {opts}  `(table?)` Optional parameters:
		• {iwad_path} (`string?`, default: nil)
		  Path of the IWAD file to use.  If nil, select from a menu.
		• {kitty_graphics} (`boolean?`, default: nil)
		  If true, enable kitty graphics protocol support.
		  |actually-doom-kitty|
		• {tmux_passthrough} (`boolean?`, default: nil)
		  If true, enable tmux passthrough sequence support.
		  If nil, it is enabled only if `$TMUX` is set.
		  |actually-doom-tmux|

rebuild({opts})					*actually-doom.rebuild()*
	Asynchronously rebuild the DOOM executable. (without playing)

	NOTE: Calling this function is not usually necessary, as DOOM is
	automatically rebuilt before playing if it is out-of-date.

	Parameters: ~
	• {opts}  `(table?)` Optional parameters:
		• {force} (`boolean?`, default: nil)
		  If true, rebuild even if the DOOM executable is up-to-date.
		• {cc} (`string|table|nil`, default: nil)
		  C compiler to use.  If string, it is the name of the
		  compiler executable.  If nil, falls back to `$CC` if
		  defined, otherwise `cc`.  It is assumed the compiler
		  understands GCC/Clang-style command line arguments; if not,
		  then it can be set to a table with the following fields:
			• {compile_cmd} (`fun(src_path: string, object_name: string): string[]`)
			  Function called with the path of the source file to
			  compile and the name of the object file to produce.
			  Must return a |vim.system()|-style `{cmd}` used to
			  build the object file.
			• {link_cmd} (`fun(object_names: string[], exe_name: string): string[]`)
			  Function called with a list of object file names to
			  link and the name of the DOOM executable to produce.
			  Must return a |vim.system()|-style `{cmd}` used to
			  link the object files into the exectuable.
		• {result_cb} (`fun(ok: boolean, err: any?)?`, default: nil)
		  Optional function that is called after the rebuild has
		  finished.  If `ok` is true, then the rebuild completed (or
		  was skipped) with no error.  If `ok` is false, then the
		  rebuild failed, and `err` indicates the error.
		• {ignore_lock} (`boolean?`, default: nil)
		  If true, rebuild without acquiring a lock.  This may cause
		  problems if a rebuild is already in progress!
