## Prerequisites

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) v0.11+. (LuaJIT support is recommended for
  performance reasons, but not required; check `:version`)
- Linux.
- C compiler with support for the [C99 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99).

## How to play

Install it via your favourite package manager like any other plugin, then run
`:Doom`.

The [shareware version](https://www.doomworld.com/classicdoom/info/shareware.php)
of DOOM is included for your convenience.

For more information regarding controls and such, consult
`:help actually-doom.txt`.

### Kitty graphics protocol

Though optional, for increased performance and visual clarity, the game is
best experienced in a terminal that implements the kitty graphics protocol
with support for Unicode placeholders.

See `:h actually-doom-kitty` for details. (And `:h actually-doom-tmux` if using
tmux)

## FAQ

### Why do the controls feel clunky?

Historically, it's not possible to receive precise key press and release events
within the terminal.

Fortunately, the [kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/)
provides the ability to [detect these events](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#event-types),
but [Neovim currently lacks support](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27509)
for this.

### Why no Windows/Mac/whatever support?

There's no technical reason, it's just that I daily-drive [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)
these days.

If you're able to get things working on your platform (and if your code isn't
too messy ðŸ˜‰), feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/seandewar/actually-doom.nvim/pulls)
with your changes.
